			<h2>Hobby</h2>
			<p>I love video games. In my spare time, gaming is the main entertainment activity. I have played, or watched, or known all the famous video games over the past 5 years. It does help me have my own judgement about what kind of games is fun and good for me. Besides video game news, I also pay attention to electronic product including iPhone, Macbook, video cards and game consoles. I think the most notable product in 2020 is Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X, which marks the beginning of 4K age.</p>
