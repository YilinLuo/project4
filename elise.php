			<h2>Film & Media Studies</h2>
					<p>
						After a few brief explorations of Golden Age film history (courtesy of essays in my high school English department), I discovered that the  limitations and unique communication style of film make it pretty hard to get a read on. When there are endless moving parts: the intention; the production; the hundreds of people running interference; the decisions of every single cast and crew member; and the layers on layers of metadecisions make unraveling a movie nigh impossible. Also: really fun to try and puzzle together, picking apart a whole hour and half piece, looking for any set of patterns I could possibly dig out. After another class, I learned to appreciate analysis and production- I decided to take a film class when I went to the UofR, and over two years, I had done a fairly even amount of constructing and deconstructing video. I decided to major in the production track.

			<h2>Brain and Cognitive Science</h2>
					<p>
						Tied up in my interest in film was always an interest in psychology. Between what the many communicated intentionally, what the audiences understood, and where the signal breaks and fills with static along the way (in many interesting cases, to the betterment of the film overall!) there is a whole lot to look at. I started with BCS as my intended major, but ultimately decided that I wanted to specialize in film. Still, psychology is an incredible field, and one with a huge number of unknowns and areas of active research. I was curious about both psychology and neuroscience (fields which have overhauled several major areas of reasearch, even just in the four years of me being at the U of R!)- BCS seemed like the ideal crossover.</p>


			<h2>Brain and Cognitive Science</h2>
					<p>
						I knew little about computer science coming out of high school and decided to try and improve the situation with an intro programming class. I really enjoyed the class. Especially interesting to me was the way it changed the way I thought. I like to program in part as a way of creating and in part because of the more linear attributes- because of the way it interlocks. Unlike most of the other areas I study, programs have an exact way of fitting together, piece by piece- no matter how complex it is. That way of thinking helped me in every other subject I studied: it was completely opposite to the way I normally approach questions. After another year, I decided to persue a minor and gained experience with versatile programs I may not have ever used otherwise. I have absolutely no doubt I will use this experience throughout my life.

			<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
						History was a minor I fell into sideways. I have always liked to learn and apply history, especially in political science. Over four years, I spontaneously decided to take several courses on music, conflicts, periods of upheavel, and pieces of history that are missing, difficult to access, or which have been stripped away entirely. One of my favorite classes involved transcribing letters from a family in the 1800s, an experience that I found both surreal and surprisingly moving. In the end, I had a minor.
