## choreography
Overall, our pages are organized by alphabet order and general-to-specific order (a kind of hierarchy).

We have 4 four pages including home page, Bo's page, Emely's page and Kim's Page. Following the general to specific order, we decide to put home page on the left most in the navigation bar. Then Bo, Emely, Kim are arranged in alphabetic order.  

Within the home(index) page, each person's selfie is grouped in alphabetic order from left to right. And a "Know More..." anchor is below each selfie for users who are interesting to know more about us.

Within each personal page, we decide to use general-to-specific order from top to bottom. There are 4 sections - overview, early years, major course list, hobby. Overview is summary of the page so it is the most general section. Early years is the summary of our past 20 years so it is the second most general section. Major courses and Hobby are really specific sections. Hobby is the most specific one because everyone has their own special leisure activity.
